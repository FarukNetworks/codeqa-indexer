18-Feb-25 14:23:46 - The purpose of the `scan_document` function is to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on a given image file to extract text from it. The function uses the OpenCV library to load and preprocess the image by converting it to grayscale, which enhances the performance of OCR. The Tesseract library is utilized to interpret the characters in the preprocessed image and return the extracted text as a string. The function's input is the file path to the image, and it outputs the detected textual content, making it useful for digitizing printed documents or images containing text.

18-Feb-25 21:01:14 - Can you provide a detailed data flow analysis of the `DataFlow` class in the provided Python code? Specifically, please highlight the interactions between the `add_data_source` and `transform_data` methods, detailing how data is stored and transformed within the `data_sources` and `transformed_data` dictionaries. Additionally, could you elaborate on potential use cases for the `get_data_flow` method, the implications of using lambda functions for transformations, and suggest modern libraries like `pandas` or `numpy` that could enhance data handling in this context? Please ensure to touch on best practices for error handling and data validation in the implementation.

19-Feb-25 10:26:13 - Can you provide a high-level architectural graph using Mermaid syntax that accurately represents a microservices architecture? Please include specific components such as the API Gateway, a Load Balancer, and various microservices communicating with different types of databases (e.g., SQL and NoSQL). Additionally, include important perspectives like service discovery, authentication/authorization mechanisms, and error handling through centralized logging. Aim to utilize the following components:

```mermaid
